Form Functionality Library - Console Logs
==========================================

This file will contain console output from testing the form library.

To generate logs:
1. Compile the TypeScript: npx tsc
2. Open index.html in a browser
3. Open browser console
4. Interact with the form
5. Copy console output here

Expected log types:
- FormState initialization
- Module initialization (branching, multiStep, validation, errors, summary)
- Field value changes
- Step navigation
- Branch evaluations
- Validation results
- Error handling
- Summary updates

The logs will help verify that all modules are working correctly and provide debugging information for any issues.
