# 🚀 WEBFLOW IMPLEMENTATION - Timestamp Cache-Busting

## ✅ **Correct Implementation for Webflow**

You'll add this directly in **Webflow Designer**, NOT in any HTML files.

### **Step 1: Access Webflow Custom Code**
1. Open your **Webflow project** in Designer
2. Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon)
3. Navigate to **Custom Code** tab
4. Scroll to **Footer Code** section

### **Step 2: Add the Script Tag**
In the **Footer Code** field, add:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/form-functionality-library@1.7.3/dist/index.min.js?t=1738195200"></script>
```

### **Step 3: Publish Your Project**
1. Click **Publish** in Webflow Designer
2. Choose your domain/staging site
3. Confirm the publish

### **Step 4: Test on Your Live Webflow Site**
1. Visit your **published Webflow site** (not the Designer preview)
2. Navigate to your form
3. Try to proceed without filling required fields
4. **Error messages should now appear!** 🎉

## 🔍 **Verification on Live Site**
Open browser console on your published Webflow site and run:
```javascript
console.log('FormLib version:', window.FormLib?.version);
// Should show: "v1.7.3 ROBUST ELEMENT LOOKUP"
```

## 📝 **Important Notes**
- ✅ Implementation is done in **Webflow Designer Custom Code**
- ✅ Test on **published site**, not Designer preview
- ✅ The `test.html` file is only for local development testing
- ✅ Timestamp `?t=1738195200` forces unpkg cache refresh
- ✅ No file editing required - all done through Webflow interface

## 🔄 **For Future Cache Issues**
If you need to force cache refresh again:
1. Generate new timestamp: Run `Date.now()` in browser console
2. Update the script tag in Webflow Custom Code with new timestamp
3. Republish your Webflow project

**🎯 This resolves the unpkg caching issue and gets your v1.7.3 error message fixes working in your live Webflow project!**
